What is the difference between Stateful authentication (Session-based) and Stateless authentication (JWT)?
Why do modern systems prefer JWT?**

ANSWER:
Stateful Authentication (Session-based)
Server stores session data (user identity, roles, etc.)
Client sends session ID (cookie) on each request
Server uses that ID to fetch user info from memory / Redis / DB
🔻 Problems
Server must remember every logged-in user
Difficult to scale horizontally
Requires:
Sticky sessions OR
Centralized session store (Redis)
Higher memory usage on server


Stateless Authentication (JWT-based)
Server does not store session
JWT itself contains:
user identity
roles
expiry
Client sends JWT with every request
Server only validates token, no lookup required


🔥 Why Modern Systems Prefer JWT
1️⃣ Horizontal Scalability
Any server instance can validate JWT
→ works perfectly behind a load balancer
2️⃣ No Session Storage
No server memory usage
No Redis dependency just for auth
3️⃣ Better for Microservices
Same JWT works across services
No shared session store needed
4️⃣ Reduced Server Coupling
Server doesn’t care who handled the previous request

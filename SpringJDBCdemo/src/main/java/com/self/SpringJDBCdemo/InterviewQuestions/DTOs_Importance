QUESTION:
In your project, did you use DTOs? Why not expose Entities directly to the API layer?

ANSWER:

Yes, we used DTOs in our project.
We never expose JPA entities directly because:
1️⃣ Security – Prevent exposing internal fields
Entities often contain:
passwords / hashed values
internal IDs
audit fields
foreign keys
Exposing them leaks table structure & sensitive information.


2️⃣ Prevent Over-posting (Very important in interviews)
If you expose entities, a user can send fields you're not expecting:
{
  "price": 0,
  "isAdmin": true
}
Spring will bind them → dangerous.
DTOs allow only allowed fields.


3️⃣ API Contract Stability
Entities change often due to:
new columns
DB optimizations
relationship changes
If you expose entities → every DB change breaks frontend APIs.
DTOs act as a stable contract.


4️⃣ Avoid LazyInitializationException
Entities have relationships (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne).
If controller serializes an entity directly:
Jackson tries to access lazy-loaded fields
You get LazyInitializationException
DTOs avoid this by mapping only required fields.


5️⃣ Performance
Large entities may contain:
collections (hundreds of rows)
heavy relational graphs
DTOs send only the required projection, avoids unnecessary DB fetch.


6️⃣ Prevent exposing internal model design
DTOs hide:
table names
relationships
internal business logic fields
Architectural encapsulation.

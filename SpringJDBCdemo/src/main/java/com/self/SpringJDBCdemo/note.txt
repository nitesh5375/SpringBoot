What is a Spring Bean? (Simple Explanation)

A bean is just an object, but…

👉 its lifecycle is managed by Spring, not by you.

You normally create objects like:

ModelMapper mapper = new ModelMapper();


But when we say:

Spring creates it

Spring manages it

Spring injects it

Then that object becomes a Spring Bean.

⭐ So a bean is simply:
✔ An object created by Spring (not by new())
✔ Registered inside Spring container
✔ Reused anywhere using @Autowired
✔ Singleton by default  meaning only one object is created of a class.
✔ Controlled entirely by Spring
⭐ But where do beans come from?

They come from:

1️⃣ Classes annotated with @Component, @Repository, @Service, @Controller, etc.

These get auto-detected.

2️⃣ Methods annotated with @Bean inside a @Configuration class

These are manually created beans (like ModelMapper).

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a fundamental design principle in software engineering, where the control over the flow of a program or the creation/management of objects is inverted from the custom user code to a framework or container.

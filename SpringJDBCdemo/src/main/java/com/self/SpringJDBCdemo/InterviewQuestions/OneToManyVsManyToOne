QUESTION:
What is the difference between @OneToMany and @ManyToOne?
And in a real project, which side should own the foreign key and why?**

ANSWER:

@OneToMany
One parent has many children
Example: One User → Many Orders
Usually mapped as mappedBy side (non-owning)

@ManyToOne
Many children point to one parent
Example: Many Orders → One User
This is the owning side (the side that holds the foreign key)


🔥 Which side should own the Foreign Key? And why?
✅ The FK should always be on the @ManyToOne side (the many side).
Why?
1️⃣ That’s how relational databases work
The child row (Order) stores:
user_id (FK)

2️⃣ Inserting new child records requires knowing the parent
When creating a new Order, you must know which User it belongs to.
So FK naturally belongs in Order (many side).


3️⃣ Makes cascading and updates predictable
Deleting a user:
CASCADE → deletes all orders
SET NULL → clears FK
Restrict → prevents delete
This is all easy because FK is on the many side.


4️⃣ Avoids unnecessary join tables
If you make @OneToMany the owner,
Hibernate creates a join table, which is bad for performance.
Correct (FK in child table):
order.user_id
Wrong (join table):
user_order_mapping_table


5️⃣ Simpler, more natural API
You simply do:
order.setUser(user);
orderRepository.save(order);
